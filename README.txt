This is a Tower Game adapted from a CS583 Game Development class 
project made by a Teaching Assistant named Barry Evans. 

To play, you first download the files either as a .zip or cloning the repo. 
Next, you can open up the .exe file and enjoy playing. 

Basic Requirements for the game:
Folder structure with Build, Scenes, Prefabs, Scripts and Sprites directory 
with files placed correctly. All sprites and prefabs in scene. GUI elements 
connected to scripts. Cannon prefab moves Left and Right with arrow keys and 
has Cannon-controller script attached (Use transform to modify position). 
Cannon shoots Cannon-Ball when shoot button is pressed (Use forces to modify 
cannon-ball position). Target has a collider with Target-Controller Script 
attached. Target-controller script updates hit-counter UI text correctly via 
onCollisionEnter callbackWorking clean build for your target platform. 

Things I added: 
Main Menu Scene
   - How To Play Button
   - Quit Button
Special Stage
   - Cannon shoots cannons instead of cannonballs
